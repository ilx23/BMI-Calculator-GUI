## Introduction:

Welcome to the BMI Calculator GUI project! This project provides a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of height and weight. BMI is a widely used indicator of body fatness and is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.

## Features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to input their height and weight easily.

2. **BMI Calculation:** Once the user inputs their height and weight, the BMI is calculated instantly and displayed on the screen.

3. **BMI Categories:** The calculated BMI is categorized into different ranges (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese) according to standard BMI classification.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
> ```git clone https://github.com/ilx23/BMI-Calculator-GUI.git```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to have the Tkinter library installed, which is usually included in standard Python installations.

3. **Run the Application:** Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
> ```python bmi_calculator.py```


4. **Input Height and Weight:** Enter your height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) in the respective input fields.

5. **Calculate BMI:** Click on the "Calculate BMI" button to see your BMI displayed on the screen.
